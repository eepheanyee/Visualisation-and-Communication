# Loan Data Exploration
## by Kenechukwu Ifediorah


## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
  - This [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0) explains the variables in the data set.
  - The dataset is stored in a CSV file which has been downloaded and saved in this project folder for easy access.
  - The dataset generally contains 2 categories of listings. Loan listings `pre-2009` and Loan listings after 2009 period (`post-2009`). What this indicates is that some features of the listings are only available for pre-2009 listings while some other features are available for only post-2009 listings
  


## Summary of Findings

 - Majority of the borrowers have a stable source of income. They were either employed, full time workers or self-employed
 - Credit rating is not really a major deciding factor in distribution of loan
 - Majority of borrowers earn betweeb 25000 - 75000 USD
 - Most of the loans were taken for debt consolidation
 - Most of the ChargedOff and Defaulted loans were taken by employed borrowers
 - The line plot on both scatter plots indicates that there is a direct relation ship between Borrower APR/Borrower Rate and Original loan amount. The interest rate decreases as the original loan amount increases.
 - People with higher income have a tendency to borrow higher amounts but also borrow less while people that earn between 0-5,000 borrow more often even though they tend to borrow lesser amounts.
 - Borrower rate and Borrower APR are directly proportional and almost always equal. The line plot pretty much shows this already.
 - We can see that borrowers with the highest credit ratings have the lowest interest rate and those with lower credit ratings have a higher interest rate which increases as the loan amount increases.


## Key Insights for Presentation

 - For the presentation. I will be explaining the relationship between the income range of borrowers and the loan amount
 - I will also elaborate on the influence of credit rating on Loan amount
 - Finally, I will explain the relationship between Employment status and Loan status
